# Covid 19 Data Analysis
Preprocessing and merging COVID 19 and World Happiness datasets to calculate needed measures and preparing them for an Analysis.

# Motivation
We’re all operating in unprecedented times due to the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in society and our workplaces. The sheer fluidity of change forced us to deal with in the month of March alone seems surreal. It is bewildering to think that a seemingly isolated number of cases in Wuhan, China, reported to the WHO on December 31st have meteorically risen to nearly 330k confirmed cases and 14.4k deaths across over 180 countries as of Sunday, March 22nd. 

As society grappled with the public health and economic challenges manifesting in COVID-19’s wake, businesses rushing to realign themselves to this new reality are looking for technology to help. Data analytics in particular is proving to be an ally for epidemiologists, as they join forces with data scientists to address the scale of the crisis.

# About
In this project, we are going to work with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.  We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.

# Process overview
